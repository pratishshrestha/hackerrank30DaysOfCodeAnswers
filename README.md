Hackerrank 30 Days of Code Answers

I am totally newbie to python. Started with Automate the Boring Stuff with Python and acquired vast knowledge from it. I only completed chapters till Manipulating Strings, i.e., Chapter 6. Then, I felt like to learn code problems where I initially encountered to Hackerrank 30 days of Code. I have got help from different websites and github for solving the codes. 

The code problem starts from day 3. 

Thank you.
